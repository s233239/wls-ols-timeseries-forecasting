# WLS-OLS Time Series Forecasting

**Exploring global (OLS) and local (WLS) linear models for short- and medium-term forecasts of Denmark‚Äôs motor vehicle time series.**

This repository implements time series forecasting using **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** and **Weighted Least Squares (WLS)** models. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model fitting, forecast evaluation, and visualization. Implementations are provided in **R** and **Python**.

**Date:** February-March 2024

## ‚öôÔ∏è Problem

- Forecast Denmark‚Äôs monthly motor vehicle counts using historical data.  
- Compare **global linear trends** (OLS) vs. **local weighted trends** (WLS) for short- and medium-term predictions.  
- Evaluate model performance and visualize forecasts, prediction intervals, and residuals.

---

## üí° Methodology

- **OLS (Global Linear Model):** Fits a linear trend to the full dataset and forecasts future values with confidence intervals.  

- **WLS (Local Linear Model):** Uses exponential decay weights to emphasize recent data. Implements recursive updates for efficient parameter estimation and multi-horizon forecasting.  

- **Evaluation & Visualization:**  
  - Residual diagnostics and autocorrelation analysis  
  - RMSE for short- and medium-term forecasts  
  - Comparison of OLS, WLS, and naive persistence models  
  - Forecast and prediction interval visualization

## ‚ö° Key Skills Demonstrated

- Time series modeling (OLS, WLS)  
- Forecasting and prediction interval calculation  
- Recursive parameter updates for dynamic models  
- Residual analysis and model evaluation (RMSE, diagnostics)  
- Visualization in R (`ggplot2`) and Python (`matplotlib`)  
- Data handling with Excel and scripting for reproducible workflows  

---

## üîß Optional Improvements

- Explore **multi-variable time series** or additional features for forecasting.  
- Incorporate **automatic lambda selection** for WLS using cross-validation.  
- Extend to **continuous or hybrid models** combining OLS/WLS with advanced machine learning.
